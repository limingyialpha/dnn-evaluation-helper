# TODO
# this class provides an interface for the dnn.py in the same package
# to access the training data (crossed boxes and empty ones too)
# please do not save the training data in the project itself, or else
# it will take hours to "commit"
# Public and protected methods, data structures, classes and so on
# must be implemented to achieve the goal above.
# Please pay attention to the randomness of the training data given to the
# dnn.py and have in mind that 75% of the data will be used to train the dnn
# and the rest 25% should be use to validate the correctness of this dnn.
# If you have problems -> Ask Li
